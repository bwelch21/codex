# Food Allergy Assistant

A comprehensive monorepo application designed to improve quality of life for people with food allergies, specifically focusing on safe dining and travel experiences.

## üöÄ Overview

This application provides essential tools and information for individuals with food allergies to navigate restaurants, travel, and daily food choices with confidence and safety.

### üéØ Mission
To create a safer, more accessible world for people with food allergies by providing reliable information, community support, and practical tools for everyday situations.

## üèóÔ∏è Monorepo Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo with three main services that work together:

```

  - CORS configured for frontend communication

#### 3. **Frontend** (`services/frontend/`) - Port 5173
- **Purpose**: User interface and experience
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Features**:
  - Modern React application with hooks
  - Comprehensive design system
  - Component-based architecture with single responsibility
  - Real-time API integration with loading/error states

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0 (see `.nvmrc` for exact version: 18.18.2)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **nvm** (recommended for Node version management)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd codex
   ```

2. **Use the correct Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   nvm use
   # If the version isn't installed: nvm install 18.18.2
   ```

3. **Install all dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start all services**:
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   ```

5. **Open the application**:
   - **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
   - **Web Server API**: http://localhost:3001
   - **Internal API**: http://localhost:4000

### Alternative Setup

If you prefer to start services individually:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start each service in separate terminals
npm run dev:api        # Terminal 1 - API Service
npm run dev:web-server # Terminal 2 - Web Server  
npm run dev:frontend   # Terminal 3 - Frontend
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Start all services with one command
./start-dev.sh          # Starts all services with process management

# Stop all services
./stop-dev.sh           # Gracefully stops all running services

# Individual service management
npm run dev:api         # Start API service only
npm run dev:web-server  # Start web server only
npm run dev:frontend    # Start frontend only

# Monitoring and testing
npm run status          # Check status of all services
npm run test:all        # Test all API endpoints
npm run test:web-server # Test web server endpoint
npm run test:api        # Test internal API endpoint
npm run test:frontend   # Test frontend availability
```

### Build & Production

```bash
# Build all services
npm run build

# Build individual services
npm run build:api
npm run build:web-server
npm run build:frontend

# Production start (after building)
npm run start
```

## üì° API Endpoints & Integration

### Current Working Endpoints

#### Web Server (Public API) - http://localhost:3001
- **GET** `/api/hello-world`
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "message": "Hello, World!",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
      "service": "web-server"
    }
  }
  ```
- **GET** `/health` - Service health and uptime

#### Internal API - http://localhost:4000  
- **GET** `/api/ping` - Internal connectivity test
- **GET** `/health` - Service health and uptime

### Frontend Integration

The React frontend successfully connects to the web server and displays:
- ‚úÖ **Hello World Message**: Fetched from `/api/hello-world`
- ‚úÖ **Service Information**: Shows timestamp and service name
- ‚úÖ **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ **Refresh Functionality**: Manual data refresh capability

### Node.js Version Issues
If you encounter Node.js version conflicts:
```bash
# Ensure you're using the correct version
nvm use 18.18.2

# Verify versions
node --version  # Should show v18.18.2
npm --version   # Should show v9.8.1 or compatible
```

### Service Won't Start
```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -i :3001  # Web server port
lsof -i :4000  # API port
lsof -i :5173  # Frontend port

# Clean restart
./stop-dev.sh
./start-dev.sh
```

### Dependencies Issues
```bash
# Clean install
npm run clean
npm install
```

## ü§ù Contributing

1. **Follow existing patterns**: Use the established code style and architecture
2. **TypeScript first**: Ensure all new code has proper type definitions
3. **Component architecture**: Follow single responsibility principle
4. **Test your changes**: Use the provided testing commands
5. **Update documentation**: Keep README and comments current

### Development Guidelines
- Use the design system tokens for consistent styling
